# 🚀 Student Performance Prediction – End-to-End Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **production-ready, end-to-end Machine Learning system** designed to analyze and predict student academic performance using demographic, socio-economic, and educational factors.

The project demonstrates the **complete ML lifecycle**, from raw data analysis to cloud deployment, following **industry-standard ML engineering and MLOps practices**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Student academic performance is influenced by multiple factors such as:

- Gender  
- Parental education level  
- Test preparation course  
- Socio-economic background  

Manual analysis of these factors is inefficient and subjective.  
This project builds a **data-driven Machine Learning solution** to accurately predict student scores and generate actionable insights.

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach
The solution follows a **modular and scalable ML pipeline**:

1. Data ingestion and validation  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering and preprocessing  
4. Model training, evaluation, and selection  
5. Prediction pipeline implementation  
6. Docker containerization  
7. Cloud deployment on AWS
